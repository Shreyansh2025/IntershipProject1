## ðŸš€ Getting Started  

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running.  

### Prerequisites  

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:  

- A modern web browser
- Code editor (e.g., VS Code)
- Git

### Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/Shreyansh2025/IntershipProject1.git  
   ```  

2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash  
   cd IntershipProject1  
   ```  

3. **Create a new branch (optional but recommended)**  
   Itâ€™s good practice to work on a new branch to keep the `main` branch clean and avoid conflicts:
   ```bash  
   git checkout -b my-feature-branch  
   ```

4. **Make your changes**  
   Now you can start making changes to the project. Feel free to edit files, add features, or fix bugs.

5. **Track your changes**  
   To add changes youâ€™ve made to the staging area (ready for commit), use:
   ```bash  
   git add .  
   ```

6. **Commit your changes**  
   After staging the changes, commit them with a meaningful message describing what youâ€™ve done:
   ```bash  
   git commit -m "Describe the changes you've made"  
   ```

7. **Push your changes to GitHub**  
   Push your changes to your fork or branch on GitHub:
   ```bash  
   git push origin my-feature-branch  
   ```

8. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**  
   Go to the GitHub repository page, and you'll see a prompt to create a new Pull Request for your pushed changes. Provide a title and description for the PR and submit it.


    
### Synchronizing with the Upstream Repository (if applicable)  
If you are working on a forked repository, you may want to keep your fork up to date with the original repository.

1. **Add the upstream remote** (if you havenâ€™t already):
   ```bash  
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git  
   ```

2. **Fetch the latest changes from the original repository**:
   ```bash  
   git fetch upstream  
   ```

3. **Merge the changes into your local repository**:
   ```bash  
   git checkout main  
   git merge upstream/main  
   ```

4. **Push the updates to your fork**:
   ```bash  
   git push origin main  
   ```
